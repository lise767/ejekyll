This is the official website of Nicola Yoon, this houses the different books she has written, movies her books have inspired, a short biography of her life and her accomplishments to state a few. This site also introduced me to Joy Revolution Imprint which is a project created by Mrs Nicola Yoon and her husband David Yoon. Joy Revolution Imprint publishes books written by and for people of colour as a way to tell their stories. The information that I found on this site will be used in one of the Twine pages of my project. The Twine page will house a biography of Mrs Yoon and her accomplishments.

CBS Mornings. (June 5, 2021) Author Nicola Yoon discusses new novel "Instructions for Dancing" and following her passions Retrieved March 3, 2022, from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQz_U2OloV8 
This video allowed me to take a look into the reasons why Mrs Yoon writes. Before her daughter’s birth, she worked in the field of finance which she did not enjoy. Subsequently, she took up writing as a way to follow her passion and lead by example for her daughter. Thus, proving to not only her daughter but herself that one can be happy and successful when accomplishing their dreams. The information portrayed in this video will be used in the biography area of my project as it gives a feel as to what kind of author Mrs Yoon is.
